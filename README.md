# News-Explorer-Backend

This is the repository for Practicum's final project, `News Explorer App`'s backend code. 

This code sets the routes in which the API calls will refer to in order to save articles, load the saved articles, register a user, login a user, and deleting articles.

Uses `auth` middleware as well as `celebrate` and `Joi` to check validity and whether or not the user requesting information has the authorization to do so.

### The backend code is running at the following domain:
